    <h2 >History of Pakistan</h2></div>
    <p>The Partition of India in 1947 led to one of the largest mass migrations in history, with over 15 million people displaced as borders were drawn to create the new nations of India and Pakistan. The division was based on religious lines, resulting in widespread violence and upheaval. The aftermath saw between one to two million deaths as communities were torn apart and millions were forced to flee their ancestral homes to seek refuge across the newly established borders </p>
